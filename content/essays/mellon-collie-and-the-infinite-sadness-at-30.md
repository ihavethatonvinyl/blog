title: Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness at 30
date: 2025-10-23T04:37:00.000-04:00
summary: " One of the albums that was in the rotation once I got a Discman was
  Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness by The Smashing Pumpkins. With its
  two-hour run time, it was a perfect album to bookend the day’s long bus rides
  - Dawn To Dusk (Disc 1) on the dark and cold morning bus ride, and
  decompressing from the day on the seemingly longer hour ride home with
  Twilight To Starlight (Disc 2)."

The year was 1995 - I was a freshman in high school, and it was in the middle of what I now call [my age of musical awakening](https://www.downbeat.fm/downbeatfm-vol-4-track-8/).

I was starting at a new school - not just high school, but a new school in a new district where I didn’t know anyone. The hour-long bus ride was spent alone with headphones on, connected at first to a yellow Sony Sports Walkman, then later on, a Discman.

One of the albums that was in the rotation once I got a Discman was *Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness* by The Smashing Pumpkins. With its two-hour run time, it was a perfect album to bookend the day’s long bus rides - **Dawn To Dusk** (Disc 1) on the dark and cold morning bus ride, and decompressing from the day on the seemingly longer hour ride home with **Twilight To Starlight** (Disc 2).

Listening to *Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness* in 1995, as a 14 or 15-year-old kid, it felt a lot like what life was like for me, and probably many other kids. Feelings of frustration, isolation, and looking for a sense of belonging. Coupled with the pains of growing up, all while trying to figure out who you were and your place in the world, and looking for a better future.

Listening to the album now, I feel a sense of nostalgia, a longing for a simpler time - yet also the rollercoaster of emotions that comes with being a teenager. 

There are a few songs that transport me in time, and one of those songs is 1979. I’m instantly a kid again, and remember all the ridiculous things my friends and I used to do, somehow never getting into any real trouble.

As much as I love 1979, my favorite song from the album, and always will be, is Tonight, Tonight.<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NOG3eus4ZSo?si=-ZJaSUcTJogQyZ-F" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>

"Tonight, Tonight" was the fourth single from the album, and to me, it’s a weird song that got popular. In the mid-90s, when loud grunge and alternative music dominated the rock airwaves, a song emerged with incredibly nasal vocals, a full orchestra, and a video inspired by a turn-of-the-century French silent sci-fi film. Not the typical ingredients for success.

The album begins with the instrumental title track, which sets up "Tonight, Tonight" beautifully. It’s the dawn portion of the Dawn to Dusk side of the album. A new day. Things may not be going well right now, but we have each other, and there’s something to hope for and build on.

*We'll crucify the insincere tonight*

*We'll make things right, we'll feel it all tonight*

*We'll find a way to offer up the night*

*The indescribable moments of your life*

*The impossible is possible tonight*

*Believe in me as I believe in you*

Thirty years on, and I still can’t get enough of this song. 

Every part of this song is beautiful to me, but the drums are on another level. If you haven’t seen the video of [drummer Jimmy Chamberlin playing Tonight, Tonight with the drum sound elevated above the song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZoveynOZSH0&t=33s), I strongly suggest checking it out. The drumming and all of the instrumentation, including the orchestra, is an amazing feat of musicianship, but those drums, man. 

The album has a great legacy. It debuted at number one on the Billboard 200, certified Diamond in the US and nine times Platinum in total across six countries, and Gold in seven other countries by the RIAA, and a GRAMMY for Best Hard Rock Performance with Vocal (Bullet with Butterfly Wings). Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness also appeared on many best of lists at the end of 1995, and it consistently appears on “best albums of all time” lists. Five singles were released from the album (Bullet with Butterfly Wings, 1979, Zero, Tonight, Tonight, and Thirty-Three - songs that were constantly on the radio in the 90s and even today, if you’re lucky enough to live in an area with a rock station.

I’m not the biggest Smashing Pumpkins fan - outside of their first three albums (Gish, Siamese Dream, and Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness), I don’t think I could name one song. Still, the magic of Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness grabbed me 30 years ago and, thankfully, never let go.
