Hello, and thank you for visiting IHTOV. The site is on a little break from September 2nd to September 14. During that time, I will be working under the hood to make the site better for everyone. I've got a full schedule of essays and interviews for when we come back.

In the meantime, please feel free to check out the archives, and take a look at the "pitches" page to find out how you can write for IHTOV.

I will also have a special announcement after the break.

You should also check out the [patreon](https://www.patreon.com/c/IHaveThatonVinyl), where we are gearing up to talk about Prince's *Purple Rain* later in the week.

Thank you for being an IHTOV reader. Stick around for some great essays and interviews.
