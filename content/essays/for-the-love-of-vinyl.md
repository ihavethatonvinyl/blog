title: For the Love of Vinyl

summary: I could wax poetic about the deep love I have for vinyl all day long.
  The elegance of the mechanical arm floating to the spinning record, to where
  the needle kisses the vinyl, and you hear that first pop, right before the
  music begins. It was magic. Say what you will, sound on vinyl is the clearest,
  most pure sound I have experienced.  The moment I put the headphones on, and
  heard the stereophonic sounds flowing like waves into my ears, I was lifted to
  another place.

I could wax poetic about the deep love I have for vinyl all day long. The elegance of the
mechanical arm floating to the spinning record, to where the needle kisses the vinyl, and you
hear that first pop, right before the music begins. It was magic. Say what you will, sound on
vinyl is the clearest, most pure sound I have experienced.  The moment I put the headphones
on, and heard the stereophonic sounds flowing like waves into my ears, I was lifted to another place.

Coming from a big family and living in a small apartment, I don’t know what I would have done
without vinyl records. They had a profound impact on my life. We had an old stereo console
player. I think it was a Magnavox. (Which I always pronounced Magnabox). It was basically a
large floor model cabinet with AM/FM radio, speakers, and a record player all in one. Large,
yes, but for the time, very elegant. As a child, I would lay on the carpet in front of the record
player and listen to the music. Spreading out all the albums across the carpet with curiosity and
excitement as though I had discovered hidden treasure. My mother’s taste was diverse, from
easy listening to jazz.  “Sergio Mendez, Brazil 66” was played constantly. But the album that
truly made an impact on me and stayed with me through my formative years was a copy of
“The Very Best of Ferrante and Teicher.”  Although the names were foreign to a child like me,
the music was transformative.  It let loose my inner imagination and touched my soul.

“The Very Best of Ferrante and Teicher” was basically movie themes.  I must have played that
album over and over thousands of times.  I could feel the tragedy of “Romeo and Juliet” and
the loneliness echoing out of “Midnight Cowboy” before I ever saw the movies.  My love of
movie themes grew to Broadway musicals.  I could not get enough of it.  It did not matter the
origin of the story.  From the slums of Charleston in “Porgy and Bess” to the Russian Village of
“Fiddler on the Roof”, I was transported there through music.  I felt the pain and heartache
coming from the songs and music. Some of it mirrored my own pain and struggles. The first
album I bought was “West Side Story”, from the original play.  I later bought the soundtrack
album from the 1961 movie version.  I can vividly remember my older sister slamming the
bedroom door in my face as I belted out “Something's Coming” in our small New York City
apartment.  The records were my ticket to freedom.  I remember forcing my niece to sing duets
with me from “The Me Nobody Knows” and “Sweeney Todd”.  I was such a nerd.  Even up until
today, my love of Broadway musicals is still strong.  Of course, I listened to all types of music.
My family had varied tastes, but it was my mother’s Ferrante and Teicher’s album that created
the undying passion and love affair for vinyl records.  Living in New York, you could always find
record shops and department stores to search for your latest desire, but the best was yet to
come. 

 I discovered the “Colony Records Store” on the corner of West 49th Street and Broadway.
It was my playground.  You could find any, and I mean any type of record there.  Even with
a vague description of a song or an artist, they could locate whatever record you were
searching for.  “I found it at the Colony” was one of the main signs over the entrance of their
door.  All the sale assistants were “cool” guys who had a library like expertise of music and
records.  It seemed like they were just hanging out, not really working, while they dropped
knowledge on you. I remember asking one of my favorite sales assistants, Kenneth (we came
so frequently we were on a first-name basis with the staff), if Lesley Gore (A singer from the
1960s) was singing a song from an old Beach Blanket Bingo movie I had seen.  (I told you I was
a nerd).   I sang part of the song for him while my embarrassed sister (the same one who
slammed the door in my face) shrank with embarrassment. She murmured to Kenneth, “It was
one of those 'B” movies.”  Stone-faced, he replied, “More like a “C” movie”.  But he went in the
back, and not too long afterward, we heard the song playing over the loudspeaker.  The singer
was Donna Loren’s “It Only Hurts When I Cry”.  These were the days, way before the internet.
But these guys knew their stock.  Colony Records wasn’t just a store; it was more like a
community of music lovers from all walks of life who came together.  You never knew who you
would run into.  Many Broadway actors went there.  I met someone from the chorus of
“Sweeney Todd”.  I was excited but refrained from demonstrating to her my rendition of
“Joanna”.  Oh, how I miss those days of endless hours of living through the music of that
moment.  Those albums lifted me up with joy and even cradled me with comfort when I needed
it.  Vinyl records, some may call them vintage or classic.  Vintage?  Classic?  No.  I call them
precious.
