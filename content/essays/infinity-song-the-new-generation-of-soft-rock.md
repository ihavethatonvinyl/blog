Pure Talent, Raw Passion and Self Discovery are not just words used to describe Infinity Song’s latest album “Metamorphosis”, but are emotions and actions the album implores you to explore, this body of work that channels the raw emotions of growing and figuring out who you're meant to be. 

In an Era of hyper-produced pop records, *Infinity Song* is not afraid to be true to who they are and what makes them unique while evolving and finding what truly works for them. They stand out not just for their incredible vocal talent but also for the sincerity, depth, and emotion they bring to music. 

A family band composed of siblings, Infinity Song is breathing new life into soft rock, reshaping it for a generation that craves emotional honesty and sonic soulfulness made up of Abraham (32), Angel(28), Israel(27), and Thalia “Momo” (26) Boyd born in Detroit, Michigan and raised In the Big Apple. Their lives have always been musical with their first experience being singing in their father John Boyd’s choir with all their siblings and later turned into them busking on the streets of New York from Bethesda Terrace in Central Park to Grand Central Station and Times Square which led them to be being discovered by Jay Z through director Jeymes Samuel who sent him a video of them performing, they were signed to Roc Nation and went on to release their first Major Label Record *Mad Love in 2020*. 

All this led up to a culmination of perfect moments that caused “Metamorphosis”, their 2023 Soft Rock Album, to be Born. It’s one thing to be ready and talented, it’s another to find your sound, one that's made perfectly for you that it seems like an overnight success. That's what Metamorphosis is, a mixture of readiness and opportunity, they took a chance on themselves and created something that’s so different from “Mad Love” but is a perfect extension of them as Infinity Song. 

Metamorphosis is a beautiful testament to growth, identity, and the many shades of human emotion. It's a coming-of-age record, an exploration of self-discovery that doesn't shy away from vulnerability. Whether it's the ache of unrequited love or the sting of envy, every track on the album feels deeply lived-in, almost confessional. 

The deluxe version of the album contains 11 original songs and one cover of Fleetwood Mac's “Dreams” which some may say is a bold addition to their album for the fear of comparison or critique but one listen would change your mind entirely. There’s rarely an instance where a cover is objectively and truly owned by the artist covering it but this is one instance I would say it is, truly on par and some days even surpasses that of the original, it’s by far the best cover I’ve heard.

The track *Comedy* strips love of its romanticized grandeur and exposes the hollow ache that exists and the reality that can follow its absence. It's raw, melancholic, and steeped in honesty, something that resonates long after the song ends with the lyrics “*I thought romance was meant for me. Oh, what a fantasy, but now I see and Mother doesn’t get the joke. Where I want love and I get none, I cried for weeks when the last one left. Oh, isn’t that hilarious”* expressing the almost comedic but deeply painful elements of constantly trying and failing at love and how in this play of life you don’t get the genre you want.

On the other end of the spectrum is *Haters’ Anthem*, a bold confrontation of jealousy and resentment. It's a striking portrayal of the anger and bitterness that can brew beneath the surface, especially when you’re stepping into your power and finding your voice. There’s a reason why this was the track that went viral on social media, it’s a deeply honest portrayal of emotions especially in this day and age of social media and the “cringe factor” where people hate to see others and achieve especially when we haven’t reached there yet. 

Then there’s the title track *Metamorphosis* which forces you to self-explore and deeply introspect on who you are and what you want to be, with lyrics that go from “*I've never had a decent answer to a single question I don't say my opinions too loud, I'm always second-guessin'*”  where they introspect on who they are to *“What I'd give, to give it all I've got, What I'd do, to be something I'm not”* and *“And sometimes I don't like myself, can I be someone else? Someone who makes their dreams come true and drinks from wishing wells”* where we wish we were better or wish we were someone else and finally transitions and completes the metamorphosis *“But look at all the things you did and look at your metamorphosis, Finally, you've found your gift and now you're on a rocket ship”* 

At the heart of *Metamorphosis*, it isn't just the lyrics, it's the harmonies. There’s something magical about sibling voices blending, and they use that to full effect. Each track is layered with rich, intricate harmonies that feel effortless but are breathtaking. 

The vocal chemistry is undeniable, and it's clear that these harmonies have been years in the making shaped by shared childhoods, shared dreams, and a shared love for music. Each sibling has a song where they shine the most while still being incredibly cohesive, Abraham is the lead vocalist in *“No One Even Comes Close”* where he belts out tunes of a love so deep and true, Israel in *“Pink Sky”* sings about finding your path in the in between, Angel and Momo blows us away on their rendition of *“Dreams”* and *“Slow Burn”*.

With Comparisons to the Mamas and the Papas, Earth, Wind and Fire and Fleetwood Mac already arising, it’s only a matter of time before they achieve mainstream stardom with their fresh take on music as well as their seamless, natural, and emotionally powerful music.

Infinity Song’s Metamorphosis is more than an album, it’s a moment. It’s a reminder that music doesn’t need to shout to be heard. Sometimes, the softest notes carry the loudest truths. 

In a world that sometimes seems too loud and chaotic, Infinity Song dares to be gentle, honest, and deeply human. 

They move with a true sense of who they are and are not afraid of standing out. This is soft rock reimagined. This is Infinity Song.
