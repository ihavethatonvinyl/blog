*Today's Q&A Remix is with music writer Drew Beringer*

### Have you ever bought a record just for the artwork?

Not explicitly but if there’s an album that I just kind of like but the artwork (or variant) is fire I’ll pick it up.

### What is your most memorable vinyl buying experience?

Going to Inner Sleeve Records in Wausau WI in the winter of 2015 - we found a sealed copy of the Sleater-Kinney box set in color.

### What’s the most treasured album in your collection and why?

The aforementioned Sleater-Kinney box set - my then-girlfriend now-wife bought it for me when we miraculously found it at Inner Sleeve. The why is being saved for a future essay ;-)

### What’s the first area you head for in a record store?

New releases then the new used section if I don’t already have a plan of what I want to accomplish on that visit.

### What one record in your collection would you be most eager to share with new friends?

I love showing off my copy of Deafheaven’s *Sunbather*. Not only is it an excellent record, the package is phenomenal with the die-cut center and I have the first pressing splatter out of 300 which is gorgeous and fits the vibe of the album perfectly. 

### Are you a completionist when it comes to artists? Which artist do you have the most records from?

Yes I am - the artists I have the most records of are Alkaline Trio, Bright Eyes, Converge, The Cure, The National, Paramore, Sleater-Kinney, Touché Amoré, and The Wonder Years. 

### What is/are your white whale records?

Deftones*’ White Pony* on promo 2xLP red variant is the biggest white whale for me that I will probably never realistically own. The last white whale record I did acquire was The National’s *Trouble Will Find* Me box set. The one I am currently on the hunt for is the self-titled Cure album from 2004.

### What is your greatest “score;” could be on value or just rarity or something you were looking for the longest?

I have a lot of these I feel - the greatest one is still the Sleater-Kinney box set and the most recent one is finding the Ten Bands One Cause variant of Modest Mouse’s *This Is A Long Drive For Someone With Nothing To Think About.*

### Who/what got you hooked on records?

This is a great question. I had always been curious about the hobby but it wasn’t until one Christmas my former partner bought me a Sony LP-120 and records from The Postal Service and Bon Iver as gifts and that’s what started it.

### What genre is most represented in your collection?

It’s probably a healthy mix of indie, emo, and heavy music.

### Tell us a little about your favorite record store

I’ve lived in Indianapolis for over a decade now and my favorite store is [Luna Music](https://www.lunamusic.net/). The aura there is perfect, the used section is always fire, and the staff is super friendly and knowledgeable. It’s a great part of the city too so the vibes are immaculate.

### What’s the weirdest record you own?

I dunno about weirdest but it’s probably the last two Bluey records on picture disc. I abhor picture discs but these are records to play with my 3 year old son and he loves dancing to them and seeing the pictures spinning on the turntable and that’s all that matters to me.
