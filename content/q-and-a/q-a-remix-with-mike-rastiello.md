*The Q&A Remix is a frequent column on IHTOV in which people from all walks of life answer a set of pre-written questions about their vinyl collection. Today we welcome friend of the blog, Mike Rastiello*

### Have you ever bought a record just for the artwork?

*Mending Wall* by Angst. It was never available on streaming, and songs only popped up on YouTube years after I bought the album. It’s really good, and as it turns out they were a huge influence on Frank Black and the Pixies and are probably one of those “your favorite band’s favorite band.”

### What is your most memorable vinyl buying experience?

One of my earliest record fairs that I went to, I was flipping through some crates, and I found a promotional copy of *London Calling* by The Clash. I am of the mind that I would rather own a previously owned and loved record, than some soulless repressing. I was on the hunt for a cool copy of some of my favorite and most important albums. That album that I found in that dark hotel ballroom in New Braunfels, Texas was the first album in my collection that really fit both of those criteria.

### What’s the first area you head for in a record store?

The new arrivals of pre-owned records. Then I browse the rock bins, mostly looking for specific artists.

### What’s the most treasured album in your collection and why?

I don’t know that I have many that I “treasure”, but I have a few that I would be bummed if I lost somehow. Most of my records are “replaceable” at the right price point, but I’d probably be most bummed about losing any autographed or rare/promo copies of records that I have.

### Are you a completionist when it comes to artists? Which artist do you have the most records from?

It depends on the artist. If they are an all time fave, then yes. I am being very conscious about shelf space, so I’m trying to not buy too many records that I won’t regularly listen to. As far as the most albums I have for a given artist, Springsteen (50), The National (27), Modest Mouse (22), Queens of the Stone Age (17), and The Beatles (15). These include studio albums, EPs, &” singles, compilations, live albums, fan club exclusives, or variant colors (because I am a sucker).

### What is/are your white whale records?

Right now the only Desert Sessions EP that I am missing is *Vol. 1* which is selling for over $300 on Discogs. So it would either be that or the OG pressing of Queens of the Stone Age’s *Songs for the Deaf.*

I would say the “script font” cover of Springsteen’s *Born to Run*, but that sells for over $5,000 on Discogs, so I wouldn’t even put that on a list. That would be more than I’ve paid for some of my cars over the years.

### Do you have a favorite live record?

[*Cherry Tree Vol. 3* by The National](https://www.discogs.com/release/19248457-The-National-Cherry-Tree-Vol-3). It’s from their fan club where they send you a live record every year. Volume 3 happens to have been recorded in Austin, Texas, and I was at the show.

### Who/what got you hooked on records?

I grew up with records for a large chunk of my childhood. My first record was [Bert & Ernie Sing-Along](https://www.discogs.com/master/616013-Bert-3-Ernie-Bert-Ernie-Sing-Along) when I was really young, like 3 or 4.

### What are your first memories of listening to records?

Playing my Sesame Street records on my little Sears record player that looked like a pair of blue jeans.

### What genre is most represented in your collection?

Rock at the macro level, Alternative/Indie Rock at the micro level.

### Tell us a little about your favorite record store

There are 2 or 3 stores that I hit regularly, but my favorite is[ Breakaway Records ](https://breakawayrecordshop.com/)in Austin, TX.  They have a great and friendly staff, and regularly get in new pre-owned records. I often resell records there that I don’t listen to any more, and browse while they price them out.

I like to go to the record store on Saturdays and browse for a few hours, then drive down the street to a great pizza place for a few slices. I call these “Mike Days” and they are the best days.

### What’s the weirdest record you own?

Not “weird” weird, but odd to me, but I have a 12” single of D[e La Soul’s Me Myself And I](https://www.discogs.com/release/353297-De-La-Soul-Me-Myself-And-I) which is a “three-sided” record. The “third-side” is just a second grove cut into the B side of the record, so you have to put the needle down in just the right spot to hear the C side.
