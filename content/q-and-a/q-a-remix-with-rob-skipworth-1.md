**Have you ever bought a record just for the artwork?** 

Yes!  Almost all of the Chemical Brother’s records are done by an artist named [Kate Gibb](https://www.instagram.com/kategibbprint?igsh=ZHBvaHN5dTZpMHRz).  She does screen printing and the uniform style makes their discography so cool visually!

**What is your most memorable vinyl buying experience?**

 I bought LL Cool J’s first album direct from DJ Shadow at a record show in LA

**What’s the most treasured album in your collection and why?**

 Currently it's The White Room by KLF.  The UK release has mixes/samples never heard in the US so it was like discovering a whole new version of old faves. 

 

**What one record in your collection would you be most eager to share with new friends?**  

The self titled album by Home Brew.  It’s a New Zealand hiphop group that I had to order from a shop in Germany. Apparently the group was pretty caught up in drugs and dissolved after this amazing album. 

**Are you a completionist when it comes to artists? Which artist do you have the most records from?** 

Chemical Brothers.  Over 60 records with albums, eps, singles, promos.

**What is/are your white whale records, something you have your eye on but haven’t been able to find?** 

Lately its been a lot of 90s electronica that I missed back in college: Roni Size - Reprazent, Morcheeba - Who Can You Trust, Gus Gus - Polydistortion, Groove Armada - Goodbye Country (Hello Nightclub). I keep a list on my phone for when I hit up stores (or get a little bonus from work).

**What is your greatest “score;” could be on value or just rarity or something you were looking for the longest?** 

I got a Louis Armstrong box set on Amazon that had been incorrectly priced at $12.  Found a Third Man Vault release at a Goodwill and got a $100 Loretta Lynn set for 75 cents.

**Who/what got you hooked on records?**

 MTV’s Amp’d show back in the 90’s.  It was a late night electronica show that was a pivotal moment for my musical tastes.

**What are your first memories of listening to records?**

  The Happy Hamsters.  They were the budget friendly Alvin & The Chipmunks.  I also remember getting the *We Are the World* 45.

**Tell us a little about your favorite record store**

**What’s the weirdest record you own?** 

A Japanese artist Takeo Ischi who does German Beer Barrel Polka.  It's autographed! 

**How has your record collection and appreciation for vinyl evolved over the years, and what has influenced your tastes?**

  As the collection has grown and organization has become required, I find myself more and more enjoying the whole process surrounding records - Digging, purchasing, cleaning, sleeving, cataloguing, tweaking the turntable, constantly fiddling with the stereo.  It's all so much more fun than simply hitting play on Spotify.

**What’s the last record you played?**

 Underworld - *Strawberry Hotel*

*Rob Skipworth is a retired recording engineer who spent 15 years working in Atlanta studios during the height of the crunk era.
Working
 on projects ranging from Brittany Spears, Usher, and Whitney Houston to
 indie acts like Washed Out and Animal Collective, the range and 
exposure to different genres has given him an appreciation of nearly all
 music. 
Lately he’s stuck on 90’s electronica, or as the wife calls it - “old guy treadmill rave”*
