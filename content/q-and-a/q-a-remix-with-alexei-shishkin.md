**Have you ever bought a record just for the artwork?**

Parquet Courts - *American Specialties*

Buying an album just because of the art is always a great experience, and when it’s a band you like, that’s even more fun. Normally buying because of album art is a bargain bin activity (and there are some amazing finds in there, for sure), but this Parquet Courts album was not that. I hadn’t heard of *American Specialties* at the time, and I didn’t recognize any tracks, but I went for it regardless. I will say, the cassette art is even better.

**What is your most memorable vinyl buying/receiving experience?**

The Clash - *Sandinista!*

Besides being one of the most underappreciated albums of all time, the vinyl experience is incredible. I think this was the first record I ever owned where I opened it and realized that albums can be packaged with “goodies” inside so to speak – in the case of *Sandinista!* there’s a big fold-out poster inside that has all the lyrics as well as drawings and more. I must have spent hours examining that thing.

**What’s the most treasured album in your collection and why?**

Sufjan Stevens - *The BQE*

I don’t recall where I found this one (maybe Mississippi Records in Portland, OR?). I was looking for *Illinoise*, but found *The BQE* instead. It had such an amazing booklet that came with it, so much crazy art, and then when I put it on, it wasn’t the Sufjan Stevens I knew at all – it was like, contemporary classical or something. It was like Glass, Adams, Reich, etc adjacent. Mind-blowing, and definitely treasured.

**What one record in your collection would you be most eager to share with new friends?**

The Clash - *London Calling*

First of all, this is the greatest album ever made. So, musically, whoever I share it with would be sure to love it. Then, from a collector nerd standpoint, this version is a Spanish pressing from 1980, so there’s some cool history there. And then finally, I got it while digging around a store in Barcelona while on a work trip, so there’s a bit of a cool personal story behind it.

**Tell us a little about your favorite record store**

I guess the answer would be whichever one I’m looking around in. To answer the question, it’s probably Human Head Records in Brooklyn. I used to work close to there and would stop in every so often to browse around. Really killer selection, especially for $5 or less. Got a friend a bunch of amazing records as a starter kit once, and it probably cost me like $25 total.

**What’s the weirdest record you own?**

It’s a toss-up. Either:

Pavement - *“Sensitive Euro Man” b/w “Brink Of The Clouds” 7” Picture Disk*

This was a gift from a friend, and I did what might be a cardinal sin among record collector heads: I framed it. Is that bad? I don’t actually care. I wasn’t gonna spin it anyway, and this way I can always have a look at it in all its glory.

Or:

Amerigo Gazaway - *Bizarre Tribe: A Quest To The Pharcyde*

This is some weird remix album that takes Pharcyde acapellas and puts them over ATCQ instrumentals. Weird in a different way than the Pavement one above.

**How has your record collection and appreciation for vinyl evolved over the years, and what has influenced your tastes?**

My record collection evolves radically every 3-5 years. This is going to sound insane, but I basically wipe out my entire collection every so often. Sometimes it coincides with moving. I’m sure this happens to a lot of folks, but every so often, I’ll look at my records and think, “Wow, I haven’t spun these in a while.” When that happens a few too many times, that’s usually when I know it’s time to purge. Luckily, I’ve always had friends who are really into records or just getting into collecting, and that’s when I pass a crate or two to them. Why not let someone enjoy them!?

**Name the top three records you own that could describe you or your vibe**

Destroyer - *Rubies*

Stephen Malkmus and the Jicks - *Mirror Traffic*

Ryan Pollie - *Stars*

**What’s the last record you played?**

Real Estate - *Days*

A classic album. My second favorite Real Estate album, but I’ve never owned my favorite (*S/T*) on vinyl. But I’ve definitely played the hell out of *Days*.
