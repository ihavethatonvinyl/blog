**Have you ever bought a record just for the artwork?** 

Yes! Courtney Marie Andrews, *May Your Kindness Remain*. I saw her pic on the cover and I thought, I bet I would like this girl’s music. And I do! 

**What is your most memorable vinyl buying/receiving experience?** 

When I first moved to NYC, someone was throwing out their vinyl collection on the mezzanine level in my apartment building… and they had a GOOD collection! So I snagged quite a few albums that way, and that started my own collection. I think that was a gift from the universe to me.

**What’s the most treasured album in your collection and why?**

 I’d be lying if I didn’t say my most treasured album is the record that my band made. I am so proud that my music exists in tangible form. And it’s very pretty!

**What one record in your collection would you be most eager to share with new friends?**

 Again… my own record! Last question I’ll answer like that. ;) 

**Do you have a definitive album of choice for spring, summer, autumn and winter?** 

I love this question, as I always think of music as seasonal. Late winter is Bon Iver, *22, A Million,* spring is Jessica Pratt, *Here in the Pitch*, summer is The Association, *Birthday*, and autumn is a combo of Beach Boys *Pet Sounds* and *The Best of Townes Van Zandt*. I reserve the right to change these albums at will. 

**What is/are your white whale records, something you have your eye on but haven’t been able to get?** 

I once accidentally broke a DJ’s vinyl record of Michael Jackson’s *Off the Wall* (because I opened up the cover art to show someone the centerfold and the record fell out) so I gave him mine. It was only fair! But I haven’t replaced it in my collection yet! 

**Who/what got you hooked on records?** 

My parents had records that we listened to as kids. They were out of style by that point, but we still had a working record player, and they seemed like relics from another time. 

**What’s the weirdest record you own?**

 Once on a date I was given *Joyfully We Sing: The Dominican Sisters of Our Lady of the Elms in Akron, Ohio*. Total Americana time capsule and I love it. 

**How has your record collection and appreciation for vinyl evolved over the years, and what has influenced your tastes?** 

As I mentioned, I really thought vinyl was a thing of the past, until it came back around and again. I couldn’t be happier about that! 

**Name the top three records you own that could describe you or your vibe**

 Phoebe Bridgers-*Punisher*, because I adore that record and it got me through the covid lockdown. The soundtrack to *Sacco & Vanzetti*, with music by Joan Baez and Ennio Morricone, which was a chance purchase I made by two artists who I love and would like to emulate. And Judee Sill, *Songs of Rapture & Redemption: Rarities & Live*, which a friend gave me and which is just great.

**What’s the last record you played?** 

I’ve been in such a Beach Boys phase since Brian Wilson died. *Feel Flows*.

NYC-based indie singer/songwriter Kathy Zimmer, together with her band Eric Sanderson and Tom Zovich (of Augustines and Pela) released two new singles entitled “Butterfly” and “Next Level” in June 2025. Last year saw the release of an EP, Debris, and a single “I Am a Queen Already”.The flavor of the music is a lovely, shapeshifting voice singing descriptive lyrics set to indie rock: something different.

 *A native of really rural Nebraska, Kathy Zimmer holds a Master’s Degree from the Cleveland Institute of Music but has been a New Yorker for a while now. A 12”vinyl record of two EPs entitled White Noise/Sparkling Smileisavailable for purchase at her shows. Eric Sanderson and Tom Zovichhave toured extensively with Augustines and Pela. The story of Augustines can be seen in the movie RISE: The Story of Augustines. Rock n’ Reel Magazine has declared Zimmerthe “latter day Joan Baez.”The Roots Music Report proclaims, “At various turns enchanting, haunting and soothing—and at times a bit of all of these—Ms. Zimmer’s sophisticated song crafting never fails to charm.*
