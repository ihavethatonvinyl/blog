*Q&A Remix is a frequent column on IHTOV in which people from all
walks of life answer a set of questions about their vinyl collection.
Today we welcome artist Clara Kay*

**Have you ever bought a record just for the artwork?** 

When I find a bin of discounted vinyl and I see a piece of artwork that sticks out to me, I’ll definitely buy the record. I have a couple of independently released classical records for this reason. I also have Lucius’ album “Good Grief” on vinyl, and I’m obsessed with the poster that came with it. It’s a full-scale poster of the album artwork and it’s gorgeous. 

**What is your most memorable vinyl buying/receiving experience?** 

I got my brother boy pablo’s “Wachito Rico” for his 18th birthday. We grew up listening to boy pablo together. We’re twins, so we got our driver’s licenses at the same time. We loved listening to music in the car together on the way to school, and “Wachito Rico” felt like the perfect record to give him to commemorate that. 

**What’s the most treasured album in your collection and why?** 

Now Now’s “Threads”. One of my favorite albums of all time — if not my absolute favorite. I think it legitimately changed my brain chemistry. 

**What one record in your collection would you be most eager to share with new friends?**

Another Now, Now one — “Saved”. I love introducing my friends to new music, and “Saved” is a record that has something for almost everybody. 

**Do you have a definitive album of choice for spring, summer, autumn and winter?**

It changes every year. This past autumn, it was “Sonder” by The Wrecks. This winter, it was Imogen Heap’s “Speak For Yourself”. This spring, it was Dora Jar’s “No Way To Relax When You Are On Fire”. I have an album listening club with some friends, which is how I was introduced to Dora’s music. The album club also introduced me to my new album of the summer, Sierra Ferrell’s “Trail Of Flowers”. It’s the best album I’ve heard all year. I was completely blown away the first time I listened to it, and it gets better every listen. 

**What is/are your white whale records, something you have your eye on but haven’t been able to get?**

Nujabes’ “Luv(sic) pt1”. That’s a dream record to own; I’m a huge Nujabes fan. I’d also love to own “Gregory Alan Isakov With The Colorado Symphony”. I love the version of “Big Black Car” on that record — I get full-body chills every time. 

**Who/what got you hooked on records?**

I was “the emo girl” all throughout middle and high school. Honestly, listening to emo bands is what got me hooked on records. I was a superfan — I’ve always been heavily involved in the fandom for whatever I’m interested in. So, at the time, that was collecting records. I started my record collection with Fall Out Boy and Panic! At The Disco Records and expanded from there. 

**What’s your favorite record to listen to on headphones?**

Charlie Puth’s “Voicenotes”. That record got me into pop music. And we’re both Berklee alums, so that’s cool!

**Tell us a little about your favorite record store**

I have a soft spot for Spinster Records in Oak Cliff, TX. Growing up, when my friends and I would hang out in Oak Cliff, we always stopped by Spinster Records. It’s a tiny but mighty store with a great selection. Honorable mentions to Movie Trading Company in Dallas (where I bought my first emo records) and Newbury Comics in Back Bay. 

**What’s the weirdest record you own?** 

A friend gifted me Green Day’s “Father Of All” as a gag birthday present the year it came out. That poor record has been sitting in my cabinet ever since. Green Day, if you’re reading this, I still love you though. 

**Have you ever bought a record based on hearing it playing in a record store?**

I haven’t! I am an avid picture-taker though. If I’m at a record store and I see/hear a record that grabs me, I’ll immediately take a picture of it to look it up after. If I think it’s up my alley, then I’ll buy it. 

**How has your record collection and appreciation for vinyl evolved over the years, and what has influenced your tastes?**

When I was younger, I was very precious with my records. I barely wanted to play them because I was afraid of damaging them. I had a realization when I started releasing my own music in college, though — if I ever put out a record, I hoped that listeners would play it to death and hang the sleeves on their walls. So, that’s what I’ve started doing. I buy more records now after adopting this mindset. Records can be so much more than something that just sits on the shelf. 

**Name the top three records you own that could describe you or your vibe**

“Vows” by Kimbra, “Riot!” by Paramore, and  the original Scott Pilgrim soundtrack. 

**What’s the last record you played?**

A Serato record! I used to DJ for fun, and I’m trying to get back into it now. I was re-familiarizing myself with the mixer’s hardware using Troye Sivan’s “Rush”. I learned how to DJ using real vinyl to start, but I think I’ll eventually make the switch over to digital for ease of travel.
