*The Q&A Remix is a frequent column on IHTOV in which people from all walks of life answer a set of pre-written questions about their vinyl collection. Today we welcome drummer Marcus Nuccio*

### Have you ever bought a record just for the artwork?

Absolutely. Truthfully, it was a CD, but it was 'Sumday' by Grandaddy, and I was 18 or 19 years old. I saw it in a bargain bin for a buck and had to buy it, just because the cover looked so intriguing. Hearing that album did kind of change my life, and has become a favorite of all time. Don't worry, I bought it on vinyl once they reissued it a few years back! Sounds even better on wax :) Last night I went to the local Goodwill and bought a few rando records based on cover art vibes alone!

### What is your most memorable vinyl buying experience?

Being a musician that goes on tour a lot, one of my favorite things to do is explore record stores in different cities. So many different vibes / ways to run a store / personnel. Most memorable to me is the smell of a store. If a store has that warm, musty odor, we're gonna find some gold for cheap. If it smells like plastic /cleaning supplies. Nothing is going to be under $40. All of my fondest vinyl buying memories take place in those shops with stacks from floor to ceiling, brown carpet, suspect drop ceilings. Finding some odd prog-rock record from the 70's is something that seems to happen at stores like that pretty often.

### What’s the first area you head for in a record store?

I'm going to "Rock" and I'm starting in the middle. I'll move either up or down the alphabet depending on where other customers are. Too often I've started at "A" and have too many records to carry by the time I get to "M". Doh!

### What’s the most treasured album in your collection and why?

A few hand-made 7" records from small local bands I loved when I first started going to shows. Shout out Lautrec, Cloud Mouth, Parrhesia... These are hand screenprinted covers made with love !!

### What one record in your collection would you be most eager to share with new friends?

Probably something chill and vibey. *Our Love* by Caribou or *Know By Heart* by American Analog Set come to mind.

### Are you a completionist when it comes to artists? Which artist do you have the most records from?

Definitely depends on the artist. Sometimes I just want to hear that one record I love, other times I need it all. Once, I went into the[ Record Exchange ](https://prex.com/)in Princeton, NJ and they had every Boards Of Canada record in stock. I had to grab them all! Or if a killer discography boxset comes out, I'll grab it if it's an artist I'm obsessed with.

### What is/are your white whale records?

For a long time it was *York Blvd* by Acetone. Acetone was a lesser known 90's band who had some whack major label deals, and never really had LP's made. *York Blvd* was routinely ~$200 on Discogs, and listings never went up! There were like 1000 ever made or something. But recently, New West issued a discography boxset with everything. I bought it as soon as I saw it. I was so pumped. Now I'm unsure! I need a new white whale....

### What is your greatest “score;” could be on value or just rarity or something you were looking for the longest?

Was sooooo pumped to find the *Movie Music* boxset by Braid for like $25 back in 2010 or so. I was on top of the world in that [Reckless Records.](https://www.reckless.com/)

### Who/what got you hooked on records?

Seeing bands put out their own 7 inches and make the art themselves was super inspiring to me. And then falling in love with 2nd wave emo before the vinyl bubble really kicked off. Many memories of being in highschool and bidding on Get Up Kids records on Ebay in study hall.

### What are your first memories of listening to records?

The first record I bought on vinyl was The Get Up Kids / Coalesce split 7". I bought a record player off of Craigslist and my dad gave me a receiver and speakers. I remember realizing that vinyl really did sound different. So much deeper and somehow more human. I bought *They Make Beer Commercials Like This* by Minus The Bear next on a beautiful rainbow swirl and I was so hooked. 

### What’s your favorite record to listen to on headphones?

*Blue Screen Life* by Pinback

### What genre is most represented in your collection?

Indie Rock


### Tell us a little about your favorite record store.

Haven't been in too long, but gotta be [Reckless Records](https://www.reckless.com/) in Chicago. Always stocked with what you want plus always a great surprise. Kind staff and usually good prices.

### What’s the weirdest record you own?

Probably the Boyz Of Paradize promo single I bought at Goodwill last night.
