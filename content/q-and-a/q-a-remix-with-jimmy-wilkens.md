*Q&A Remix is a frequent column on IHTOV in which people from all
walks of life answer a set of questions about their vinyl collection.
Today we welcome Jimmy Wilkens of Sonder Bombs and Crown Shy*


**What is your most memorable vinyl buying experience?**

It’s weird to admit but one of my most memorable vinyl buying experiences happened during early covid. Code Orange’s “*Underneath*” had just come out & it quickly became one of my favorites. At the time my turntable was alright but I had *terrible* speakers. I’m talking dinky little computer speakers from like 2003 that I found at a thrift store. So I invested in new speakers, which led me to invest in speaker stands, which led me to invest in a proper turntable stand. I went through all these setup changes just to hear this specific record as best as possible, which of course benefited long term because it improved the listening experience for all my records.

**What’s the first area you head for in a record store?**

I usually head straight for new arrivals in the new and used sections. Sometimes I find a gem in the used section for not that much. But also sometimes I leave with regret, like I still regret not nabbing up Tegan & Sara’s “*The Con*” when I saw it for cheap.

**What’s the most treasured album in your collection and why?**

I would say my signed copy of The Kills’ “*Keep On Your Mean Side*.” My friend Arfil & I made the trip from Cleveland to Detroit to see them at Saint Andrews Hall in 2015. After the show I purchased a shirt, a zine, and that record from the merch table. As we were leaving, Alison Mosshart & Jamie Hince happened to be outside smoking a cigarette & I asked if they’d be down to sign the record. The Kills have been and remain a huge influence on me so this was a pretty sick moment, they were very kind!

**What one record in your collection would you be most eager to share with new friends?**

I don’t know if this answer is a copout but any record made by any of my friends. I’m very fortunate to know so many amazing & talented people who make music and whenever I’m given the opportunity to talk about them, I will. I don’t think Barely Civil gets talked about nearly enough, for example. I would share any of their records with new friends.

**Are you a completionist when it comes to artists? Which artist do you have the most records from?**

Omg yes absolutely yes. I’ll get records that I’m not the biggest fan of if it’s the only one I have missing to complete the set. I don’t always stick to one medium though, for most artists I have some combination of CDs, vinyl, & tapes that span their discography. That being said, the artist I have the most albums by happens to be entirely on vinyl and that would be Gorillaz.

**What is/are your white whale records?**

I would love to have the System of a Down 7” they pressed a few years ago of “*Protect The Land*”. Also Gouge Away “*Dies*” would be siiiiick. Bonus answer (cuz it’s not vinyl) but any Nirvana album on tape besides “*Bleach*” would make my life. (No disrespect to “*Bleach*” - I love it and already have it!)

**What is your greatest “score;” could be on value or just rarity or something you were looking for the longest?**

Hmmm first one that comes to mind is Knocked Loose’s “*A Tear in the Fabric of Life*”. When that EP first came out, I had preordered it online on cassette along with some other merch. This was before I heard it. I loved “*A Different Shade of Blue*” but had no idea just how much they were about to elevate their sound. By the time the EP dropped all the vinyl had sold out everywhere. I wasn’t super upset about it cuz I had the tape, but the vinyl was objectively way cooler. Side A is the EP and Side B is this cool graphic whereas the tape was just a normal cassette. I got lucky though, someone I knew at a local record shop texted me and told me they happened to have one copy in store and they could set it aside if I came up right away. Needless to say, I did.

**Do you have a favorite live record?**

Bartees Strange’s “*Live at Studio 4*” hands down. I don’t understand how a live performance can sound THAT good. I almost wanted to quit music after watching/hearing that performance, Bartees is on a different plane of existence and chooses to let us observe.

**What are your first memories of listening to records?**

I remember being frustrated. I got one of those entry level Audio Technica turntables but they played just a touch too fast. And there wasn’t a way to adjust the speed, I did all the research and did all the things they said to do and I couldn’t get it to play the right speed. It was such a slight variation but I put on an album I’ve been listening to since I was like 8 years old (so I knew it WELL) and it was INFURIATING. I returned it for a new one, same problem. I eventually gave up and found on Craigslist a used mass-produced turntable from the 80’s that had a speed dial and haven’t looked back since. 

**What genre is most represented in your collection?**

I’d say indie rock & hardcore.

**Tell us a little about your favorite record store**

My Mind’s Eye in Lakewood, OH. They have a wild amount of records in such a small amount of space. It almost feels overwhelming but only because I typically go in with a budget of $40 and know there are far more treasures to be found than what $40 can handle. I always go over! I’ve found some of my fav records there. They also do consignments with local bands and local record labels & I think that’s something that separates a record store from a retail store. It feels like you’re engaging with the community there.

**What’s the weirdest record you own?**

Circling back to Code Orange’s “*Underneath.*” Not so much in content as the packaging itself. Do you remember those cards where when you turn it one way there’s one image and when you turn it another way it’s a different image? Or it makes it look like the image is moving? The front cover of this album is one giant one of those. The head on the cover is on fire and the flames move. Also the record itself glows in the dark. I can’t imagine a scenario where I start listening to that album in bright light and then it becomes dark enough for me to see it glow while it’s still spinning, but I still think it’s cool as hell.
