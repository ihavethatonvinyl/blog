summary: '"I remember when I saw the cover for Memories in Beach House by
  Seaside Lovers, I was so struck by the artwork that I ordered it without even
  listening or reading much about it. It’s a painting of a woman floating alone
  in an endless ocean, with deep-fried magenta clouds on the horizon. The record
  itself sounds exactly as serene as the cover would suggest."'

*Q&A Remix is a frequent column on IHTOV in which people from all walks of life answer a set of questions about their vinyl collection. Today we welcome Sam and Jaden of the band Steel Wool*

**Have you ever bought a record just for the artwork?** 

SAM: I’m mostly a dollar bin scavenger, but every now and then I allow myself to ball out on a Light In The Attic reissue. I remember when I saw the cover for *Memories in Beach House* by Seaside Lovers, I was so struck by the artwork that I ordered it without even listening or reading much about it. It’s a painting of a woman floating alone in an endless ocean, with deep-fried magenta clouds on the horizon. The record itself sounds exactly as serene as the cover would suggest. 

**What is your most memorable vinyl buying/receiving experience?** 

SAM: I saw A. Savage perform at Zebulon last year, and he mentioned between songs that he’d found a forgotten box of copies of the lesser known Parquet Courts’ debut, *American Specialties*. It’s a great record, but not nearly as widely heard as everything else they’ve put out, because it’s not on most streaming platforms. As soon as his set ended, I made a beeline for the merch table to buy a copy. I’ve always been a huge Parquet Courts fan, so to have the opportunity to buy such a cool, rare record directly from the artist was really special. I asked him to please reissue *Denton After Sunset*, but I don’t think he will, so I hope he finds another box tucked away in his basement. 

**What’s the most treasured album in your collection and why?** 

JADEN: Like everyone else my age with an interest in punk, the music of Jeff Rosenstock is pretty fundamental for me. In high school I was stunned when he announced a show at a sports bar in Waterloo, Iowa, about 20 minutes from where I lived at the time. The sound was rough – at that show he actually forgot to play “Nausea”, and there was an unintentional encore when he got back on stage to play it like 5 minutes after the set. But for me it will always be a perfect set – a brush with the spirit of diy that allowed Jeff to play this bar that would be left off the date list of any industry-managed artist of his size. I picked up copies of *We Cool* and *Worry* there, complete with signatures and doodles from Jeff.

**What one record in your collection would you be most eager to share with new friends?**

JADEN: During hangs I always default to my copy of Shintaro Sakamoto’s *Dancing With A Phantom*. I’m a sucker for melancholy conveyed with a carefree attitude, which makes me predisposed to city pop totally being my jam. It’s a perfect vibe no matter the mood.

**Do you have a definitive album of choice for spring, summer, autumn and winter?**

SAM:

**For spring**: I went to college in upstate New York, where the winter really drags its feet, so from March to May, I would listen to *Star Stuff*, the collaborative effort of Chaz Bundick meets the Mattson 2. Sitting there in my freezing cold, poorly insulated student housing, that record helped transport me to some warmer, imaginary place. 

**For summer**: The Acetone double LP anthology, *1992-2001*, is the perfect set of records to throw on the turntable on a lazy summer evening when you’ve been out in the heat all day and know you’re probably not going to be leaving the house again any time soon.

**For fall**: We don’t really have seasons here in LA, more like a range of “warm outside” to “very hot outside”, so I’m drawing from east coast memories where the seasonal changes were more pronounced. That said, every fall I return to Built to Spill’s *Keep It like a Secret*. Something about that record just reminds me of riding my bike over dead leaves.

**For winter**: Beach House’s *Thank Your Lucky Stars*. It was released less than two months after *Depression Cherry*, which kinda got all the glory, so to me, *Thank Your Lucky Stars* encapsulates the lonesome, moody feel of the wintertime.

**What is/are your white whale records, something you have your eye on but haven’t been able to get?**

JADEN: I’ve always been more of a record store browser than someone who orders lots of stuff on Discogs, so there’s lots of glaring omissions from my collection. My Iowa heart is ashamed when I look through my collection and see the lack of Slipknot, Stars Hollow, and In Loving Memory. As far as stuff that’s just too expensive though – I’d love to get a copy of Brave Little Abacus’ *Masked Dancers* on CD, which tends to go for like 150$. One day, maybe.

**Who/what got you hooked on records?**

JADEN: I was always a CD collector, and I guess when I got to the ninth grade I felt I needed a more mature form of collecting. My older brother set me up with copies of Pavement’s *Quarantine the Past* and Parquet Courts’ *Sunbathing Animal,* and it just expanded from there.

**What’s your favorite record to listen to on headphones?**

SAM: *Green* by Hiroshi Yoshimura is my go-to self-soothe, solitary listen. It just takes you somewhere else. You can practically feel each note raining down on your skin. 

**Tell us a little about your favorite record store**

SAM: There’s a lot of record stores here in LA that are near and dear to my heart. [Freakbeat Records](https://www.freakbeatrecords.com/) in Sherman Oaks is the first place I ever drove after getting my driver’s license as a teen, and lately, I’ve been scoring some serious heaters at [Healing Force of the Universe](https://healingforcerecords.com/), out in Pasadena. But my all-time favorite hidden gem is the bookstore at the [Philosophical Research Society](https://www.prs.org/) in Los Feliz. They have an incredible selection of imports, and I’m a bit of an obi strip fanatic. I got this really rare Gunichi Yamaguchi and His Luana Hawaiians record there, I can’t find anything online about it. Reverse image searching the cover art returns zero results. 

**What’s the weirdest record you own?** 

SAM: *Sound Communication By The Bottlenosed Dolphin* by the State University System of Florida Institute for Advanced Study of the Communication Processes. It’s literally just dolphin noises, with interspersed biological information spoken by a very tired-sounding man. Bought it from the dollar bin at Arroyo Records in Highland Park, and I see now that it’s listed for $40-$80 on Discogs, which is kinda hilarious. Do not spend $40 to $80 on this record. 

**How has your record collection and appreciation for vinyl evolved over the years, and what has influenced your tastes?**

JADEN: I have a lot of records from 2016-2017, because with my high school disposable income I was buying lots of new releases. Buying records is still my favorite way to support new artists, but these days I’m a bit more particular about what gets added, and more likely to pick up oddities I find when flicking through the stacks.

**Name the top three vinyls you own that could describe you or your vibe**

SAM: *Adventure* by Television; *Pleasure* by Pure X; *Painful* by Yo La Tengo. 

**What’s the last record you played?**

JADEN: Supper by smog! It’s a pretty underrated one in the Bill Callahan discography, and features some of his hardest rocking moments to date. “Feather By Feather” and “Our Anniversary” are all-timers in the Drag City indie folk space for sure.

*Splitting the difference between early post-punk and shoegaze revival, Los Angeles 4-piece Steel Wool rose to insignificance in the summer of 2024. The band, consisting of Sean Lissner (guitar/singing), Jaden Amjadi (bass/screaming), Evan Landi (drums), and Sam Schlesinger (guitar), blends ethereal synthesizers and fuzzed-out guitars to deliver soft-yet-abrasive anthems for sitting in traffic on the 101.*
