*The Q&A Remix is a frequent column on IHTOV in which people from all walks of life answer a set of pre-written questions about their vinyl collection. Today we welcome international rock star Chris Farren.*

### Have you ever bought a record just for the artwork?

I have an Against Me 12” *From Her Lips To God’s Ears* which has an Ad-rock remix on it I think - ANYWAYS the art is by my favorite artist [Steak Mtn](https://www.instagram.com/steakmtn/) and it’s one of my favorite things he’s done. It’s really just a bunch of yellow feathers but I love it.

### What’s the first area you head for in a record store?

Wherever I think it’s most likely the “Chris Farren” records will be, and then I will either have a smug sense of satisfaction if they have any or I will start spiraling into a small “what am I doing with my life” crisis.

### What’s the most treasured album in your collection and why?

My wife bought me a FROZEN soundtrack picture disc like 10 years ago and it was nice of her to do that for me, I think she had to drive like 2 hours to get it so I think it would be rude of me to say anything else.

### Which artist do you have the most records from?

 I am not but looking at my collection it seems I have the most stuff from Mt. Eerie/The Microphones, Tegan & Sara.

### Do you have a favorite live record?

I love *Beach Boys Party!* which is actually a fake live record with pre-planned mistakes. I also have and like Neil Diamond’s *Hot August Night.*

### What are your first memories of listening to records?

My mom had a bunch of great records that were my introduction to albums and music as a whole really. Billy Joel - *52nd Street* and Queen - *Night at the Opera* are the ones I remember listening to the most.

### What genre is most represented in your collection? 

Looking at my collection now it is either “records that came out between 2005-2012” or “records of bands I went on tour with”. Is that a genre? Indie rock?

### What’s the weirdest record you own?

I have a Suicide Machines test press because a record label I was on sent it to me by accident once. I guess it’s not a weird record but it was a weird experience putting on a test press of what I thought was going to be one of my albums and it was decidedly not that.
