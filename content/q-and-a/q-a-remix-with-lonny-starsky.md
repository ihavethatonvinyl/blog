*The Q&A Remix is a frequent column on IHTOV in which people from all walks of life answer a set of pre-written questions about their vinyl collection. Today we welcome Lonny Starsky of the Acid Flashback at Nightmare Beach*

### Have you ever bought a record just for the artwork?

When I saw FIDLAR on my 18th birthday. I remember buying a METZ record that night because of how cool I thought the cover looked.

## What is your most memorable vinyl buying experience?

My grandma and I used to do record store day every year at this place that was also a furniture store. We got up super early and waited in line before the sun was up just to get the Green Day trilogy demos on vinyl in 2014.

## What’s the first area you head for in a record store?

I always go for international stuff first to see if i can get anything cheaper than on ebay. Like anything from Japan from the 70s & 80s.'

## What’s the most treasured album in your collection and why?

*An Insatiable High* by Masayoshi Takanaka. Finally tracking down a copy of that was so cool. But holy shit it was expensive.

## What one record in your collection would you be most eager to share with new friends?

*Absolutely* by Dijon. I’ve probably shown that album to more people in the last two years than anything else.

## Are you a completionist when it comes to artists? Which artist do you have the most records from?

Certain artists I try to have everything. My biggest collections are The Gaslight Anthem and anything Brian Fallon has ever made.

## What is/are your white whale records, something you have your eye on but haven’t been able to find?

*Last American Hero* by James Ferraro. I’ve been obsessed with that album for a couple years and finding a copy on vinyl would be so cool. A friend gave me a tape with that and *Adrenaline’s End* on the B side and it changed my brain.

## What is your greatest “score;” could be on value or just rarity or something you were looking for the longest?

Finally getting *Blonde* by Frank Ocean was a huge win for high school Lonny.

## Do you have a favorite live record?

I’ve got a 6 LP Bruce Springsteen Live box set and that’s gotta be up there. I think my number one spot goes to Pink Navel’s album *Epic*.

## Who/what got you hooked on records?

I started collecting them freshman year of high school because Hot Topic did those splatter pressings of all the Blink-182 albums. I thought they looked cool and I wanted to waste money on cooler stuff because they stopped making Bionicles.

## What are your first memories of listening to records?

My grandma bought me my first record player and the first record she got me was *Modern Vampires of The City* so listening to that with her and my mom on Christmas morning is a great memory.

## What’s your favorite record to listen to on headphones?

I’ve never listened to vinyl with headphones. I just always blast it as loud as possible. Especially now that I live alone and don’t have any neighbors. But now I’m trying to think of what the first record I listen to with headphones should be.

## Tell us a little about your favorite record store

When I lived closer to St. Louis, DIY Emo bands stayed at my house and they’d usually give me a record or I’d buy one at their show that night if I had cash.

[Gold Pan Records](https://www.instagram.com/thegoldpan/?hl=en) in Hillsboro, IL. It’s tiny and only open on weekends but I love going there. I always bring stuff in to sell and I actually met the person who was buying everything I brought in a few months ago.

## What’s the weirdest record you own?

*Cease & Desist* by Blarf.

*My name is Lonny Starsky & I make all the music in a project called The Acid Flashback at Nightmare Beach. I started writing songs in 2017 after I saw Foxing live for the first time. I live on a farm like 60 miles north of St. Louis and that’s the closest city that has a music scene so I played & attended a lot of shows there growing up. I do album artwork, music videos & merch designs for my friends bands. Last year, after moving to a place where I couldn’t even get internet, I started reading a ton, which just made writing a lot easier. I try to make a new song every day or at least record a couple ideas. My album Jazz From The Other Side of The House is coming out every Friday until the end of time.*
