### Have you ever bought a record just for the artwork?

Mastodon’s *Leviathan* LP, though I grew to like it.

### What is your most memorable vinyl buying experience?

When the shop owner sold me the last copy he had of The Clash’s *Combat* *Rock* on the day of release because I was a regular there.

### What’s the first area you head for in a record store?

Punk/New Wave

### What’s the most treasured album in your collection and why?

My original pressing of *London Calling* from 1980. It’s long been my favorite album.

### What one record in your collection would you be most eager to share with new friends?

I like playing The Beach Boys’ *Sunflower* or *Surf’s Up* LPs to people who think they only did surf and hot rod music.

### Are you a completionist when it comes to artists? Which artist do you have the most records from?

Yes I am. Probably Bob Dylan.

### What is/are your white whale records, something you have your eye on but haven’t been able to find?

The Clash - *From Here to Eternity Live*

### What is your greatest “score;” could be on value or just rarity or something you were looking for the longest?

I found an original pressing of The Gits’ “Second Skin” 45 on grey vinyl at a record show in London six years ago.

### Do you have a favorite live record?

Probably The Who’s *Live at Leeds*

### Who/what got you hooked on records?

My local store when I was in college. The owner had great taste and was always recommending stuff I probably wouldn’t have listened to on my own. He’d let me have them for next to nothing.

### What are your first memories of listening to records?

Borrowing my older cousin’s Beatles & Beach Boys records.

### What’s your favorite record to listen to on headphones?

Corny, but Pink Floyd. Either *Meddle* or *Wish You Were Here*.

### Tell us a little about your favorite record store.

Currently my favorite is[ Station 1 ](https://www.stationonerecords.com/)in Pompton Lakes NJ. It’s housed in an old railroad station, has great selection and prices, and the owners are cool and knowledgeable.

### What’s the weirdest record you own?

A Housemartins picture disc shaped like a toilet.

### How has your record collection and appreciation for vinyl evolved over the years, and what has influenced your tastes?

I went from vinyl to CDs then back to vinyl. I much prefer the sound of vinyl.

### What’s the last record you played? 

Saint Etienne’s new one, *The Night*
