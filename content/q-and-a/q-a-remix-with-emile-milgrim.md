**Have you ever bought a record just for the artwork?** 

YES! The one that comes to mind immediately is George Harrrison’s *Electronic Sound*: <https://www.discogs.com/master/56083-George-Harrison-Electronic-Sound>

**What is your most memorable vinyl buying/receiving experience?**

 Long before Kate Bush’s catalog was reissued by Fish People, there were very few vinyl versions of *The Red Shoes* in circulation. I was heavy into the album at some point and my friend Tatiana sent me a copy of the Greek pressing from 1993 so I could have it on vinyl. This is definitely one of Bush’s least-lauded records, but Prince plays and sings on it, so that’s pretty cool in and of itself. The track “Lily” is a fuckin’ banger IMO: https://youtu.be/xKjRCr3V4js?si=ceEyGQNmeSzR283H

 

**What’s the most treasured album in your collection and why?**

 Signed copy of Songs: Ohia’s *Axxess and Ace*. The inscription says “No second chance.”

**What one record in your collection would you be most eager to share with new friends?** 

*The Voyager Golden Record*. We can pretend we’re members of an outer space species and are just hearing “Earth Sounds” for the first time. 

 **Do you have a definitive album of choice for spring, summer, autumn and winter?** 

This is basically a trick question since where I live it’s essentially summer year-round. I’ll go with a really broad answer and say that the type of stuff on the turntable most often is folk blues/country blues. I like to keep it simple. 

**What is/are your white whale records, something you have your eye on but haven’t been able to get?**

 The The - *Dusk;* Vincent Gallo - *When*; The Eat - *Communist Radio* 7”

**Who/what got you hooked on records?** 

My dad used to buy me 7” singles when I was little. The obsession with physical media definitely began there. 

**What’s your favorite record to listen to on headphones?** 

First thing that came to mind was Portishead - *S/T*, so I’ll go with that. 

**Tell us a little about your favorite record store.**

 I can’t say I have a favorite, but I love the ones where the folks working there are genuinely excited about the “record store as community hub” angle of things. Yes, there really are shops where folks aren’t rude or sarcastic or just ignore you completely. The first place I tend to go when visiting a new city is a record store, and an inviting atmosphere beats a super rare collection for me anyday. Less gatekeeping, more grooving, please! Shouts to my neighborhood shop Sweat Records too! 

**What’s the weirdest record you own?**

 I picked up these 4” flexis of Otis Redding and Shirelles singles at a record swap like 13 years ago. The product line is called “Hip-Pocket Records” and was produced by Philco/Ford (yes, the car company). They’re in envelopes with art on the front and highlights/instructions about the format on the back, like “Drop them or sit on them… they are almost indestructible!” https://obsoletemedia.org/hip-pocket-record/

**Have you ever bought a record based on hearing it playing in a record store?**

As a record store patron, most-likely, but I can’t recall a specific instance. I like when places only play what they actually have available for sale though. It’s a bit of a letdown when you hear something you’d want to buy and a clerk is all “Oh, that’s my roommate’s SoundCloud” or some shit…

**How has your record collection and appreciation for vinyl evolved over the years, and what has influenced your tastes?**

Between running a record label for nearly 20 years and being the music buyer at a record store for 11 (at the aforementioned Sweat Records), my collection has become fairly massive. Through both ventures, but particularly the record store, I’ve learned so much more about music than I thought possible. My tastes are influenced by the idea that “if you like it, that’s good enough!”

**Name the top three records you own that could describe you or your vibe**

. I’m a sad bastard at heart, so let’s go with: David Thomas Broughton - *The Complete Guide To Insufficiency*, Low - *Things We Lost In The Fire*; PJ Harvey - *Is This Desire*

**What’s the last record you played?**

 Sound Directions - *The Funky Side of Life: <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/i7uCHT014vE?si=3NIOMOsZdAqfrRQr" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>*



*Emile Blair Milgrim (she/they) is a sound designer, musician and teaching artist who grew up in Miami in the 80s and 90s immersed in all music she could find, from classical to freestyle.

In 2011 she returned to Miami, where she continues to play drums in bands (no basements), still runs Other Electricities, DJs, teaches, and develops collaborative programs/projects with a perpetual love of music and sound as the catalyst. Much of the work she creates is inspired by South Florida’s landscape and the unique experiences continually encountered and shared within it.
