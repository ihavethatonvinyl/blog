*The Q&A Remix is a frequent column on IHTOV in which people from all walks of life answer a set of pre-written questions about their vinyl collection. Today we welcome friend of the blog Nick Costa*

### Have you ever bought a record just for the artwork?

Definitely. Many times. The most memorable one was technically a CD, but back in 2007 or 2008 I had $5 to kill on a Best Buy gift card. I went in and on display was an album that said “$4.99” and the artwork looked cool. Figured it was essentially free so I had nothing to lose. That album was *Not Animal*. by Margot & The Nuclear So & So’s, and it ended up kind of changing the way I think about songwriting. To this day I still think Richard Edwards is one of the best and most underrated songwriters around. It’s not my favorite album by them (that would be *Slingshot To Heaven*) but it is a formative album for me. 

### What is your most memorable vinyl buying experience?

The one that strikes me from recent memory was my first time going to Amoeba in Hollywood, probably about 2 years back. I had my Discogs wantlist open, and was expecting one or two things. They had damn near everything. It was unreal. My bank account was sore the next day, but I sure was happy.

### What’s the first area you head for in a record store?

Recent arrivals, every time. There’s something great about not having to choose where to look. Just having a pile of records the universe kind of chose for you, and the magic of pulling the one you were looking for but weren’t even thinking about. That’s why you go!

### What’s the most treasured album in your collection and why?

*Davy* by Coconut Records. It’s a 45 RPM picture disc, and they didn’t press many of them. My partner got it for me for Christmas a few years back, and I don’t even want to know what she spent on it, but it was so thoughtful. I cherish that record, not only because it’s one of my all-time favorites, but because of the love that brought it to me.

### What one record in your collection would you be most eager to share with new friends?

If you haven’t heard *Ram* by Paul and Linda McCartney, we are going to listen to it.

### Are you a completionist when it comes to artists? Which artist do you have the most records from?

Oh goodness, yes. If I like an artist, I want everything they’ve done. I have the most Willie Nelson records by a large margin. According to Discogs I have 40 Wille records, but I swear that’s actually closer to 50+. It’s almost an entire shelf on my vinyl wall.

### What is/are your white whale records?

My Wantlist is…extensive. Some of the most difficult ones to find are:

Lisa Hannigan - *Sea Sew*

The Living End - *Modern ARTillery + Roll On*

Lucinda Williams - *Essence*

New Found Glory - *Self Titled*

Willie Nelson - *The Story of Willie Nelson* (VMP Box Set)

### What is your greatest “score;” could be on value or just rarity or something you were looking for the longest?

I grabbed an OG copy of Margot & The Nuclear So & So’s *Not Animal* and apparently those go for a pretty penny. Got a heads up from Richard Edwards himself about Reckless Records in Chicago having it in stock, so I called them and asked if they’d ship it to me. I’m still very thrilled to have it. 

### Do you have a favorite live record?

The best live record on the planet is Willie Nelson - *Live at Budokan* however, a close runner-up is Sam Cooke - *Live at the Harlem Square Club*.

### Who/what got you hooked on records?

I had a friend in high school who was super into vinyl, specifically from underground hardcore punk bands.  We’d go over to his place and he’d pop on Lower Class Brats, The Exploited, The Unseen, The Virus, Minor Threat, Black Flag. If it was fast and sounded like shit, he had it. There was one album called *The Shape of Punk To Come* by Refused that actually sounded great, and I really became obsessed with that one. From that point on I started ordering stuff from interpunk.com and got a little old suitcase record player. I fell in love. Had a pretty solid collection before my mom somehow lost those. Most of those records could significantly raise my net worth if I still had them, but I’m over it now.

### What’s your favorite record to listen to on headphones?

Andy Shauf’s *The Party* has to be up there. The production is so dry, and not really “trippy” but it’s so incredibly layered in a way that you can’t even really notice without headphones. It’s raw and honest and I love it so much.

### What genre is most represented in your collection?

Due the sheer amount of Willie Nelson records I have, it’s probably classic country.

### Tell us a little about your favorite record store

Amoeba Music in Hollywood is truly a shop that’s worth the hype. It’s an insane selection, and great prices. However, to pick a smaller shop, my heart will always be with [Cheapo](https://www.instagram.com/cheaporecordsstpaul/) in Saint Paul, MN. 

### What’s the weirdest record you own?

I somehow ended up owning a test pressing of Barry White’s *The Man*. I have no idea how I got it, and it’s such a strange album. I love it so much.
