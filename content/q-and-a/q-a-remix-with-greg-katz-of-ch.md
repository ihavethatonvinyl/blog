### What is your most memorable vinyl buying experience?


My first vinyl purchase was going to Greene Records in Santa Ana California and picking up *Jupiter* by Cave In. Tiny mom-and-pop store specializing in punk records that no longer exists. It stays pretty memorable to me.


### What’s the first area you head for in a record store?


First the main endcaps and displays. I like knowing what's new, what the store is trying to sell, and what they're proud to have. Then jazz, funk and soul, then new rock.

### What’s the most treasured album in your collection and why?

Maybe the self-released first pressing of Krill's "*Lucky Leaves,* which I think was a pressing of 100. The first pressing of *No Regerts* by Chastity Belt is another banger. 

### What one record in your collection would you be most eager to share with new friends?

When I have people over for dinner, I usually reach for *Moanin* by Art Blakey & The Jazz Messengers first. Lately also the self-titled Kalapana album that was reissued on vinyl by the Aloha Got Soul label. 

### Are you a completionist when it comes to artists? Which artist do you have the most records from?

It's probably Pile. I have so, so much Pile vinyl. So much

### Have you ever bought a record just for the artwork?

Yes. Plenty of times. Fake Fruit's self-titled is one. Cover art is not the best way to decide how to spend $25, but it did pan out in that case.

### What is/are your white whale records?

There's a European R.E.M. greatest hits that has been lingering on my Discogs want list for quite a while. It's not rare or anything but I doubt I'll ever buy it.

### What is your greatest “score;” could be on value or just rarity or something you were looking for the longest?


I went into Origami Vinyl one time and bought the Record Store Day version of *Regretfully Yours* by Superdrag for $17 new. I love that album but after I bought it I literally never listened to it on vinyl. It just sat on a shelf in the shrink wrap. One day some guy DMed me on Discogs and asked if I'd sell it. I looked at the top sales at the time and they went up to like $100. Since my copy was still sealed, I asked like $150. He bought it in an instant. Turned out he was a hedge funder and he had me ship it to Wall Street. I probably should have asked for $1000.


### Do you have a favorite live record?

*Swiss Movement* by Les McCann & Eddie Harris. Gosh, if you don't have that, buy it now. You don't need to like jazz or live records to love it. An all-timer.


### What are your first memories of listening to records?


My dad playing The Searchers' "Bumble Bee" on 45.


### What genre is most represented in your collection?

Albums by people I know.
