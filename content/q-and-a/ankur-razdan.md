*The Q&A Remix is a frequent column on IHTOV in which people from all walks of life answer a set of pre-written questions about their  vinyl collection. Today we welcome Ankur Razdan* 

### Have you ever bought a record just for the artwork?

Yes, many times. The most rewarding example was when I bought Parka Bruthaz UK’s record[ *^H*.](https://www.discogs.com/release/2979462-Parka-Bruthaz-UK-H/image/SW1hZ2U6NTQxMTczNw==?srsltid=AfmBOoqDC7xOay67iGgfOSfIX4s9bcb1kqKUqijcu4fcYEz4Qdu8EUWc) Quite an amazing record whose quality is to mind my completely disproportionate to the amount of information (i.e. almost none) out there about them on the internet.

### What is your most memorable vinyl buying experience?

Buying the Birthday Party’s[ *Junkyard*](https://www.discogs.com/master/20060-The-Birthday-Party-Junkyard/image/SW1hZ2U6MTk4MTg2NDk=) and the record store clerk with a teardrop tattoo telling me it was a great record. And then coming home and showing it to my family who all exchanged disgusted looks based on the cover.

### What’s the first area you head for in a record store?

The C’s, for Cave (you’ll notice I am a fanatic) and Can.

### What’s the most treasured album in your collection and why?

Easily that PB UK record U I mentioned. Just because I know of no other way to listen to their music.

### What one record in your collection would you be most eager to share with new friends?

Nick Cave & the Bad Seeds’ *The Firstborn is Dead*. The cultural cache of the bluesiness can be an effective Trojan Horse for people.

### Are you a completist when it comes to artists? Which artist do you have the most records from?

God no, not enough money or frankly, interest. Most from the Bad Seeds.

### What is/are your white whale records, something you have your eye on but haven’t been able to find?

Would love to have some things that aren’t on Spotify, like *Ys* by Joanna Newsom, *Godard/Spillane* by John Zorn.

### What is your greatest “score;” could be on value or just rarity or something you were looking for the longest? Do you have a favorite live record?

I’ve got a few copies from the 60’s/70’s of my great aunt’s which she gave to me when I was a teen. So *Hejira* by Joni Mitchell I really value, even though the cover’s all beat up. And then live, the Stones’ Got Live If You Want It! Is pretty close to my heart.

### Who/what got you hooked on records?

Well I first got into the idea of listening to albums as a concept as a teenager reading about music in some of those first-gen web 1.0 amateur rock critics, like Mark Prindle, Piero Scaruffi, and the Only Solitaire guy. Back when people had their own html. From then it was a short hop to asking for a record player for Christmas at 16 and buying records.

### What are your first memories of listening to records?

Putting on John Cale’s *Paris 1919* and just listening while following along with the words on the sleeve.

### What’s your favorite record to listen to on headphones?

Nothing, with records, I always wanna hear it through the air.

### Tell us a little about your favorite record store.

[Cow Records](https://www.instagram.com/explore/locations/220283816/cow-records-ocean-beach/?hl=en) in San Diego. My family would rent a beach house on Mission Beach every summer and drive from Phoenix. And this small record shop with a nice middle aged owner is only a few blocks inland, and I would buy records on vacation and listen the next week when I got home.

### What’s the weirdest record you own?

Probably Grandaddy’s version of their record *The Sophtware Slump* but played on an old piano. Or a vinyl that contains as a single record the first CD’s worth of the multi-CD Bad Seeds b sides and rarities box set.

### How has your record collection and appreciation for vinyl evolved over the years, and what has influenced your tastes?

So it’s a funny thing. As a teenager and in college I amassed a pretty good collection, not huge, but some really good stuff. And at the end of college I took a job over in India which I knew would last several years, and I was transferring almost all my belongings over to my mom’s for safekeeping at that time. But the last semester of senior year I happened to be reading John Lydon (of PiL fame–you see where my tastes lay back then)’s memoir, where among many other things he had a passage which I found quite moving about how records are meant to be listened to and books meant to be read and he was constantly giving records away to his friends (and they to him I suppose.) And I thought that was right, the records are meant to be played, and not kept shut up tight somewhere, so I made a google doc of all my records and passed it around to my music-interested friends and told them to claim what they wanted. I passed it all out to them including many people I don’t particularly know anymore. And not all of my records were claimed (some beautiful weirdos nobody but me wanted), but a lot of the cream of my record collection is just out there in the world and I’ve never gotten back. Hopefully they are being played.

So since then, while I have supplemented and augmented my collection based on that seed of what I couldn’t give away in 2016 by stepping in at record stores every now and again, my passion for building a really big or god help me completist collection has gone out, because my attitudes to collections as a whole, as these consumer items you buy from a store to gratify yourself, I wouldn’t say I’m against it (I buy plenty of other consumer items to gratify myself after all) but it’s just not as important to me anymore. But of course, if I do find myself in a store with a good selection, there will always be things I want to buy, especially if they are rare or can’t be streamed easily.

The point of collection to me now seems much more to be about archiving and caring for what is rare. For example, speaking not of vinyls but of CDs, my buddy who worked at a flea market recently gave me two boxes of CDs. I was hesitant to take them at first, knowing the low quality of random stuff you get from flea markets and thrift stores. But it turns out these boxes were donated or sold by a person with exquisite taste and an eye for extreme rarities. So I have been processing a lot of these rare CDs (most of them without their jewel cases) into a big CD book.

Or to take another example that gets us back to the subject of vinyl, I’ll tell you a story about how I came into possession of hundreds of 45s.

Last year my family learned that my great uncle had died in York County, PA, within two hours of both me and my brother. My great uncle Ricky was a lifelong amateur musician and general prick, who left Arizona when my great-grandmother, whom he’d sponged off all his life, passed away, and took many family possessions with him, and dropped out of sight.

It turns out for several years he’d been living with a family in a farmhouse up in rural York, before coming to bad terms with the owner and moving out to a small apartment, where he himself died. And what my brother and I discovered was that Ricky had left many of his possessions at the farmhouse, and the owner had packed them all up into an otherwise empty horsebarn. And furthermore this farm owner himself had passed away more than a month before Ricky did, and his own children had quickly put the very derelict farm property up for sale. It had been sold but not yet occupied or clearly, we found when we got there, looked into in any way.

This is all to say that my brother and I then had the mission of trespassing on this empty property to recover as many of our family possessions as possible. It was also the dead of a desolate winter at the time, with the full earth covered in snow, and nobody having been over to the property to clear any of it.

The barn was of course in the very back corner of the maybe two acre property and it was a struggle just to get from our car to it and back with anything heavy. In it we found among the horse mulch many family photos, press clippings, ruined musical equipment, and some CDs of Ricky’s self-produced album. None of the family jewels which my mother had been exhorting us to find. But also something else: trunks and trunks of vinyl 45’s.

Their original paper sleeves were often rotting, dusty, dirty and home to spiders, and some of the trunks’ bottoms fell out when we tried to lift them, but the records themselves were pressed together so tightly that they were obviously in decent condition.

To make a long story short it was an odyssey to get just a few trunks to my brother’s car. Between trunks falling apart, the demoralizing effect of the snow, limited space in the car among the other things we grabbed, and the unlawful nature of our activities out in shotgun country, we made the difficult determination that not every trunk of 45s could be saved, and left that farm property forever. God knows if the new owners have salvaged some of those records we left behind.

So now I have 4 (started with 5) trash bags full of 45s sitting in my cellar. One at a time I keep a bag up in my home office and every morning I have a ritual: I grab a few 45s, discard their dirty sleeves, clean them with vinyl cleaning solution, repackage them in fresh sleeves which I order in bulk, and pile them up (and listen, of course.)

The 45s themselves are mostly from the 50’s and 60’s (with a tail through the 70’s and very occasionally an 80’s single) and very much reflect a normal guy’s taste at the time. Doo wop, pop, R&B, rock. It’s like a window into the habits of a normal Philly music-buying teen and young adult back then. Some of it is very much to my taste and has accounted for some great discoveries for me, some of it is not to my taste at all (sometimes listening to all these 50’s wedding ballads I get to thinking, gee, a British Invasion sure sounds like a good idea right now.)

But at the leisurely pace I am going it will likely take me a couple years to clean them all. I will surely keep some and maybe sell the rest to somebody who would get more out of some of these records than I. But ultimately while I could pick better records (qua music) from a store with enough money to build a personal collection out of, just by applying my own tastes, it feels like a far more important endeavor to be archiving and preserving these relics from the past that show where the musical tradition has been and helps us inform ourselves what it means to us now.

And so that kind of thing is much more important to me now than collecting records per se.

### What’s the last record you played?

Last 45 (from the Ricky collection) is a pseudo-EP that includes several Dixieland jazz numbers (incl. “Evolution Mama”) by Turk Murphy & His Jazz Band. Last LP was Basie *Jam #3* by Count Basie, which I found on the street in my neighborhood. So, two jazz records oddly enough.
