In honor of IHTOV’s first anniversary on December 17th, we have made a zine commemorating ten pieces from over the course of that year, chosen by a small committee. 

The zine will be a nice little artifact of the site. We’ve had some stellar writing on IHTOV, and the ten essays chosen are not only well written, but really hammer home the central idea of IHTOV: that people love vinyl, love sharing their passion for it and for music in general; that everyone has a story to tell about how they fell in love with the music they listen to. The stories are funny in some spots, and poignant in others, and all of them are great. 

The zines will be mailed after the holidays. They are $10 and can be purchased by sending that amount to either michele-catalano2659 at Venmo or [michele.catalano@gmail.com](mailto:michele.catalano@gmail.com) for PayPal. Please include your address in the comment field.

Commemorate one year of the I Have That on Vinyl with ten essays that I promise you will enjoy. 

Thank you for reading IHTOV and for being part of the last year.
