Hello. My name is Michele Catalano and I am a retired civil servant from Long Island, New York. 

A mission statement for I Have That On Vinyl would be simple: a place for people to share their passion for vinyl records and music and have discussions about both.

But I don’t want a mission statement. I don’t have a mission. I have a vision. And that vision is to share, in one place, my love of music, my respect for physical media, and my desire to spread good music around. A collective love letter to vinyl and to music in general. 

This is my post-retirement project, something that combines three things I am passionate about: music, writing, and making connections. Through this project, I hope to not just connect you not only with the records you know and love, but also with the records you don’t yet know. I want to connect you with people just like you; who love listening to whole albums, who love going to yard sales looking for holy grail records, who know every record store in a 25-mile radius.

You will see some familiar faces on the site, but there will always be new voices for you to listen to, new ways to discover old music, new connections to make through your love of vinyl. This is my vision. Hope you join me.
