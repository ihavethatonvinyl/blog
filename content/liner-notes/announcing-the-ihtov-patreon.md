As of this morning, I Have That on Vinyl now has a [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/c/ihavethatonvinyl). 

For a mere $5 a month, you can join in and get exclusive content like "best of" lists and side stories, you can participate in polls, make reader suggestions, leave comments and discuss music with other users, and get merch like stickers and buttons. 

Basically, I am trying to establish an IHTOV community, and Patreon is the perfect place in which to do that. I'd love for you to join and get those weekly (or more) extra posts, and talk to me about what you want from the site. The polls will be fun, and that's what I'm trying to foster here - a little fun in a bleak world. Please share this news with other fans of the site or your friend or relatives or mailman who might be interested!

[Come on in and join us.](https://www.patreon.com/c/ihavethatonvinyl) I promise good things.
