Join us at the Patreon as we embark on a new treat for members. We’re going to listen collectively to an album (on our own) and come back to the Patreon to discuss it. Here’s how it works:

The first Saturday of every month I put up a poll of five albums within a theme. You vote for the album we will listen to that month. The poll stays up Saturday and Sunday and on Monday I announce what album we will listen to that month. You then have two weeks to listen - you don’t have to own the album, streaming is okay -  and gather your thoughts before I open up a thread on the Patreon. I will be present and live within the discussion for the first few hours it’s up. 

It might be an album you are already familiar with, giving you the chance to listen again and perhaps gain some new perspective on it. It might be an album you have never heard of, and you’ll be able to impart a new listener’s voice to the discussion. It is my hope this will be much like a book club, in which we talk about, dissect, and analyze, but mostly give our takes on the music and perhaps messages within. 

The first Listener’s Club will kick off on July 5th with a poll. To start, we’re going to choose from some of my favorite albums. In the future, you will get to have a say in what we choose to listen to. 

This is an exclusive to Patreon members. [You can join the Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/c/IHaveThatonVinyl) for as little as $5 a month. With that, you get all the Patreon posts, extra content, and a free sticker, as well as frequent open discussions and access to the Listener’s Club. 

I would love it if you joined us for this endeavor.
