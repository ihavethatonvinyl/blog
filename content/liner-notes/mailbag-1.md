*Something new here at IHTOV: I’m going to do a once a week mailbag, where you, dear readers, can ask me anything you want relative to music. You can hit me up on bluesky or email me at michele.catalano at gmail with your burning questions about music, records, me, the site itself. Have at it.*

*Here’s the first installment, with questions coming from bluesky.*

**Which two artists of any era would you put on a twin bill? Nothing is off limits.**

Mike Patton and Herb Alpert, just so they can come out for an encore and “This Guy’s In Love With You” together.

**Go to karaoke song?**

I don’t do karaoke because it’s terrifying to me. Maybe, just maybe, I could get drunk enough to get on stage and sing Erasure’s “A Little Respect” because that’s a fun as hell song to sing.

**What’s your sound system setup for the vinyl?**

I have a [U-Turn Orbit](https://uturnaudio.com/products/orbit-basic-turntable?srsltid=AfmBOorHFclWhoFeV5KXA3XwxP7Ajxi83SFZMzkSVEQWYxry34Me_MOM) turntable, and Klipsch speakers. I also have a Bose CD player, and a boombox to play cassettes, but the “play” button won’t stay down so I haven’t listened to a tape in ages. I am in no way, shape, or form an audiophile. This setup is perfect for me.

**What is the most prized record in your collection?**

Monetarily speaking, I have a variant of Slipknot’s first album on “snot green” vinyl, which is worth $300. I got it because an ex used to work in Roadrunner Records’ art department. Speaking personally, I have a couple of Kevin Devine records that have personalized autographs on them (one says “nice to finally meet you!”), but I think honestly the [Raffi album](https://ihavethatonvinyl.com/liner-notes/singable-songs-for-the-very-young-and-old/) I got last week is one I am holding close to my heart. Also, my original copy of Aztec Camera’s *[High Land, Hard Rain](https://ihavethatonvinyl.com/liner-notes/walk-out-to-winter/)*, which is my all time favorite album. 

**Favorite concert venue?**

[Brooklyn Steel](https://www.bowerypresents.com/venues/brooklyn-steel). It’s just the right size, the sound is good, the sight lines are great no matter where you stand, and I found a spot right by the entrance where I can lean on the wall and still see everything. Also shout out to [Warsaw Brooklyn](https://www.warsawconcerts.com/), where you can get pierogies before the show.

**Do you have any "holy grail" albums that you've been in search of on vinyl?**

There’s a variant of Deftones’ *White Pony* that’s on transparent red vinyl, with the correct (in my mind) track listing that I absolutely covet. However, it is over $600 on discogs. So funny story, one day I was on twitter (in the before times) bemoaning that the album was so expensive, when who but Martin Shkreli showed up in my replies saying he would buy it for me. My first reaction was “fuck yeah, Martin Shkreli, spend your riches on me,” but I tempered that real quick when I remembered he’s a terrible person. I asked him to take the money and give it to a Palestinian relief fund instead, and he blocked me. That was my one lifetime chance to own this variant. Alas.

**What’s the best song to play at a sporting event?**

I mean, we are all officially sick of the usual, right? “Seven Nation Army,” “Mr. Brightside,” “Sweet Caroline” can all be banned for all I care. I personally enjoy when they play Lit’s “My Own Worst Enemy” and everyone sings along. I don’t know why 30,000 people singing “please tell me whyyyy" delights me, but it does.
